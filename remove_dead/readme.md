When I get new music, I end up playing an mp3 file through iTunes, which registers it in the library. Then, I move it to another folder and add it to the library again from there, registering the same song again. This means there's now a duplicate of the song with a dead link. To fix this problem, we can edit the iTunes library XML file and remove dead links. Then, you have to get iTunes to use your edited XML file.
