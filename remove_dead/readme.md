When I get new music, I end up playing an mp3 file through iTunes, deciding whether I like it, and if I do, I move it into a different folder. And when I'm done, I drag everything from that folder into a playlist in iTunes. When I initially play the file, iTunes registers it as part of my library. Then when I move it, that song in my library is now a dead link. Then I add it into the library again when I add it to the playlist
